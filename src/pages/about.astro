            I'm a software architect with 20+ years of experience across enterprise systems, startups,
            and everything in between. I've built IoT platforms, optimized Kafka clusters for NFT marketplaces,
            shipped ecommerce sites, and run my own SaaS.
          </p>
          <p>
            These days, I focus on AI-augmented development—using AI tools to accelerate what I've always done:
            help teams build and deliver fast.

        <h2>My approach</h2>
        <p>
          I'm not an AI hype person. I've been building software long enough to know that the fundamentals
          matter more than the buzzwords. Good architecture, clear requirements, and a focus on actually
          shipping—those are the things that make projects succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          What AI gives me is speed. Tasks that used to take days now take hours. I can prototype faster,
          explore more solutions, and iterate quickly. But the architectural rigor? That comes from two
          decades of experience, not from a chat interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use AI as a tool to move faster while maintaining the quality and thoughtfulness that comes
          from years of doing this work. If you're looking for someone to slap AI on everything and call
          it innovation, I'm not your guy. If you want someone who knows how to ship and can do it
          faster with modern tools, let's talk.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I'm based in the Kansas City area. Currently, I'm a Solutions Architect focused on AI solutions,
          transitioning to full-time consulting. Over the years, I've worked with organizations ranging
          from government agencies to startups, on projects from distributed IoT systems to consumer-facing
          web platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I run a gymnastics facility with my family and stay involved in youth basketball
          programs in my community.
