Recent news about [Tailwind CSS letting go of a significant portion of their engineering team](https://www.seroundtable.com/tailwind-css-google-drop-40725.html) has sent ripples through the development community. The report highlights a drastic 75% reduction in their engineering staff, citing a massive drop in documentation traffic and revenue, largely attributed to the rise of AI search and coding assistants.

This is genuinely upsetting news. As a huge fan and daily user of Tailwind, I've always admired the ecosystem Adam Wathan and his team built. Their business model was clever: open-source the framework, but monetize through high-quality UI kits and templates. I myself purchased their lifetime package, and for a long time, it was an essential tool in my belt.

## The AI Shift

However, the reason for their decline feels inevitable in hindsight. The article mentions AI eating into documentation traffic, but there's a deeper shift happening in how we build.

Tailwind's UI kits were valuable because they saved time. They gave you polished, production-ready components so you didn't have to build them from scratch. But today? AI coding assistants have become so proficient with Tailwind's utility classes that the value proposition of a pre-built kit is vanishing.

If I need a pricing table, a hero section, or a complex dashboard layout, I don't go to my purchased kit anymore. I simply ask the AI to build it. It generates the code seamlessly, often tailored exactly to my specific context in a way a generic kit never could. "If I want something, I'll just build it" has become the default stance because building is now nearly instantaneous.

## Applications as Cattle

This makes me wonder about the broader implications for SaaS organizations. Are we witnessing a paradigm shift in how we treat applications themselves?

In the world of DevOps, we talk about "Pets vs. Cattle."
- **Pets** are unique servers that we name, care for, and nurse back to health when they're sick.
- **Cattle** are identical, numbered instances that we replace without a second thought if they fail.

The transition from physical servers to VMs and Kubernetes marked the shift to the "Cattle" model for infrastructure. We no longer needed fully provisioned, precious servers for each task.

We might be seeing the same thing happen to application code and UI components. A polished, expensive UI kit is a "Pet"—something you buy, maintain, and adapt. AI-generated code is "Cattle." It's cheap, on-demand, and if it doesn't work perfectly, you just discard it and generate a new version.

If code is becoming this commoditized, Tailwind likely won't be the only SaaS company forced to rethink its value proposition. The tools we used to rely on for "shortcuts" are competing with a technology that makes the entire journey a shortcut.
